# Pyrogram Userbot
A Telegram Userbot based on [Pyrogram](https://github.com/pyrogram/pyrogram)

Development in progress.


## Installing
*One Click Deploy*

There is no one click deploy.. It was all a ruse. Here's what you do.

*The way I deploy*
```bash
git clone this-repo
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m userbot.
```
